# AI Voice Assistant Using React JS

This is a web-based AI Voice Assistant built with **React JS**. It allows users to interact with the application using voice commands, enabling a range of actions such as retrieving information, controlling basic functions, and navigating the web. The application leverages the **Web Speech API** for speech recognition and speech synthesis, providing a smooth hands-free user experience.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Uses the Web Speech API to convert user speech into text.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Converts text responses into speech, allowing the assistant to "speak" back to the user.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Basic NLP capabilities to understand commands like answering questions or opening websites.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Instant feedback to user commands with vocal responses.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with React JS and designed for a responsive, mobile-friendly experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React JS
